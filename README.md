What if we could stream movies or trailers in a video chat or a regular chatroom? Are you passionate about movie reviews and love giving feedback? How about checking for the next showtime of that new comedy and sending your pal an invitation for the theater closest to you? This is a React app that uses the MovieDB API to pull movie data such as cast info, trailers, overview, ratings and so on. Users will be able to give reviews, send invites for both streaming and theater viewing, and keep all of their favorite films saved on custom playlists. In addition to React, this app also uses Node and express.
